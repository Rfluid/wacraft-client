                Wacraft ("we", "us", "our") operates a multitenant platform that enables businesses
                to connect to the official WhatsApp Business API. This Privacy Policy explains how
                we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our platform or
                interact with a business that uses Wacraft to communicate via WhatsApp.

                1.1 Account Information
            </h4>
            <p>
                When you register for Wacraft, we collect your name, email address, and password. If
                you join a workspace, we also store your membership role and association with that
                workspace.

                1.2 WhatsApp Business API Credentials
            </h4>
            <p>
                To connect your WhatsApp Business Account, you provide API credentials such as phone
                number IDs, business account IDs, and access tokens. These credentials are stored
                securely and used solely to operate the service on your behalf.

            <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200">1.3 Message Data</h4>
            <p>
                When messages are sent or received through the WhatsApp Business API via our
                platform, we process message content, sender and recipient phone numbers,
                timestamps, and message status (sent, delivered, read). This data is processed to
                deliver the service and enable features such as automation and webhook forwarding.
            </p>

            </h4>
            <p>
                We process webhook payloads received from the WhatsApp Business API and any
                automation rules you configure on the platform, including trigger conditions and
                response templates.
            </p>
